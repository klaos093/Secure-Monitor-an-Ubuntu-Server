🚀 Project Idea: Secure & Monitor an Ubuntu Server (Beginner SOC & Hardening Project)  

This project will help you set up, secure, and monitor an Ubuntu server, simulating real-world cybersecurity tasks such as hardening, log analysis, intrusion detection, and vulnerability scanning.

📌 Project Goals:  
✔️ Set up an Ubuntu server (local or cloud VPS)  
✔️ Implement basic security hardening (firewall, SSH security, etc.)  
✔️ Install and configure security monitoring tools  
✔️ Simulate attacks and analyze logs  
✔️ Document everything in a report for your portfolio  

1️⃣ Set Up Your Ubuntu Server  
Option 1: Local VM (Recommended for Beginners)
    Use VirtualBox or VMware to install Ubuntu Server 24.04.

Allocate at least 2GB RAM & 20GB storage.

Option 2: Cloud VPS (Real-World Experience)  
    Use AWS, Azure, or Linode for a cloud-based Ubuntu instance.

2️⃣ Secure & Harden Your Server 🔒  

Basic Hardening Steps:

✅ Update & Upgrade Ubuntu

``sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y``

✅ Enable UFW Firewall & Allow Only Necessary Ports

``sudo ufw allow OpenSSH``  

``sudo ufw enable``  

✅ Disable Root Login & Change SSH Port
Edit SSH config:

``sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config``

Change Port 22 to another number (e.g., 2222)  
Set PermitRootLogin no

``sudo systemctl restart ssh``  

✅ Install & Configure Fail2Ban (Prevents Brute Force Attacks)

``sudo apt install fail2ban -y`` 

``sudo systemctl enable fail2ban``  

3️⃣ Install & Configure Security Monitoring Tools  

🔹 Audit Log Changes & Track User Activity

``sudo apt install auditd -y``  

``sudo systemctl enable auditd``  

Enable tracking for important files:

``sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes``  

``sudo auditctl -w /var/log/auth.log -p wa -k auth_changes``  

🔹 Set Up Intrusion Detection (IDS) with Wazuh or Suricata  

``sudo apt install suricata -y``  

``sudo systemctl enable suricata``  

🔹 Check Open Ports with Nmap

``sudo apt install nmap -y``  

``nmap -sV localhost``  

4️⃣ Simulate & Analyze Attacks (Ethical Testing)  

🔹 Run a Brute Force Attack with Hydra (Test Fail2Ban)

``sudo apt install hydra -y``  

``hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://localhost -t 4``  

🔹 Analyze Logs for Security Events  

Check SSH login attempts:

``sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed password"``  

Check firewall logs:

``sudo ufw log``  

5️⃣ Create a Report for Your Portfolio 📄  

Summarize your findings:

What security measures did you apply?

What attacks did you simulate?

How did you analyze logs and detect threats?

Use Markdown or PDF format for easy sharing on GitHub or LinkedIn.
